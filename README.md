Whisker Wishes is a modified pomodoro timer. Ideally this programs encourages students/people to focus for set durations of time and are in return rewarded with cute cats. The timer is based on the pomodoro method which encourages 25 minute focus sessions followed by either a 5 minute break or a 15 minute break after 3 repeats. Timer can be paused and restarted while maintaining the original time. Users gain coins from either using the pomodoro timer or taking breaks which can be then used to find a one random cat out of six options. Found cats are then placed in the main menu to give the user a sense of accomplishment from their efforts. 

The proposal.md was an initial blocking out of what I wanted to accomplish with the project. Although not everything was completed on the list, all of the core components were. The remaining ideas listed such as rarity or multi wishing are features that would be implemented in the future. I also would like to in the implement a more elegant cat collection menu that shows which cats have been acquired, names, date found, and perhaps some way of interacting with them. 

The requirements.txt lists the one necessary python library required to use this program. 

Inside the src file you will find the program and a Art file which contains all the neccessary art assets to run the timer correctly.
