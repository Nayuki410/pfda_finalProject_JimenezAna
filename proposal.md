## Description
Whisker Wishes is a study-aid game where the player uses wishes earned through study sessions to randomly obtain a variety of cute pixel cats. Students sometimes need an extra push to spend time studying and this game will reward that behavior. 

## Features
- Wishes
	- Wishes are obtained through timed sessions. Wishes can be used either one at a time or ten. Each wish obtains the player with a random cat or variable rareness. 
- Study Sessions
	- Study sessions are of variable length. Longer sessions give more pulls. Each session will have a timer to notify the user how much time remains before the end of the session.  
- Pause Timer
	- During study sessions a button will be available to pause the timer in case the player needs to take a break.

## Challenges
- Learning how to create pixel art
- Learning how to implement a timer into pygame
- Learning how to use mouse imputs from the player to navigate through the game.
